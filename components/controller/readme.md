## About Me

In this project we are following the MVC pattern.

The Lvgl part is the view. From here the user set up the value and read the value.

ESP_UPM_tasks can be consider as the modal class.  All the backend data is being processed here.

The controller is the middleware where all the data has been gathered and flow back to the modal.
